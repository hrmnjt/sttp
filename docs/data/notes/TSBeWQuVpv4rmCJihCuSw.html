<p>The interview process is designed to provide a signal on two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the candidate meets the job requirement and have the required skills,</li>
<li>Will the candidate be an excellent future colleague?</li>
</ol>
<p>When having discussions itâ€™s easier to get signals like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do they ask clarifying questions when they don't feel judged</li>
<li>Do they make suggestions without feeling scared</li>
<li>Do they accept direction/feedback and process it</li>
<li>Do they verbalize what they think because they are not scared to give a wrong answer</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#how"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>How</h2>
<p>Start with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's use this time to discuss a few interesting problems; let's assume we are colleagues and discussing this problem</li>
</ul>
<p>Use "We" instead of "you" because it feels more inclusive and it is</p>
<p>Sitting on the same side of the table or standing next to them when whiteboarding instead of sitting at the desk</p>
