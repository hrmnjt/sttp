Hello World!

I'm Harman (a.k.a `hrmnjt` on internet). I work as an Engineering Manager (Big Data) during the day; I'm trying to find new things to do every night.

Secure Thought Transfer Protocol (abbr. `sttp://`) is a raw stream of thoughts, and also (sometimes) medium for me to travel back in time to intercept thoughts from past - to improve and tend to them. 

Apologies if you can't understand this in the first go. Actually, nothing in here is supposed to make sense as they are working braindump - thought train. I've put this out in public to enable [[working in public|thoughts.working-in-public]].

Although, if you want to glance through what I'm [[reading]], or [[programming]] please follow through.
