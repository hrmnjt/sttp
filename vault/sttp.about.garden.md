## About `sttp://`

`sttp://secure-thought-transfer-protocol` is raw stream of thoughts. More accurately, `sttp` is a collection of loosely held opinions/thoughts (in form of notes) that I'm trying to make sense of. It is also an anchor for me to go back in time, incercept the thought and refine it based on present context.

Most of the notes or seeds might not make sense. They are not supposed to make sense as they are not finalized or permanent.
