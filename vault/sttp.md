Hello World! You have stumbled upon my corner of internet.

# i.e. sttp://secure-thought-transfer-protocol

I'm not sure how you will classify and render this website - a digital garden? a personal wiki? a blog? a non-linear manifesto? But for the sake of moving ahead I'm calling it digital garden as of now.

Secure Thought Transfer Protocol (abbr. `sttp`) is raw stream of thoughts; more like [shower thoughts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/). More accurately, `sttp` is a collection of loosely held opinions/thoughts (in form of notes) that I'm trying to make sense of. It is also an anchor for me to go back in time, incercept the thought and refine it based on present context.

Most of the notes (called seeds in garden) might not make sense until they start budding and become evergreen. Unapologetically, I would say they are not supposed to make sense as they are not finalized or permanent.

At this point, I may suggest you to read more about [[what is sttp|sttp.about.garden]] and [[why I started|sttp.about.motivation]] tending a to digital garden. Occassionally I'm asked to [[introduce myself|sttp.about.hrmnjt]] and I've tried to put some thoughts into words.
