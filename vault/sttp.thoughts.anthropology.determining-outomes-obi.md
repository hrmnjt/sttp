## Framework

> Borrowed from Mu Sigma work experience

Solution should be defined in top down approach from:
- Outcomes - end goal (solution for the problem)
- Behavior - what behaviors you would exhibit to reach outcome
- Insights - what insights you need to have to exhibit behaviors
- Findings
- Data

Going this approach lets you think about the problem from a top-down perspective instead of baising you with the data that you have.

## Context

As part of work in Mu Sigma, people were trained to **state the outcomes** in order to:
1. define your goals and outcomes when trying to solve a problem
1. make choices which align with overall outcomes during the solution phase
1. how to move ahead to next stage of outcomes

I don't 100% remember the framework. Above mentioned points are from my memory of work done. I've documented it here so that I may refer to this for getting to certain outcomes as I had to do this week at work.
