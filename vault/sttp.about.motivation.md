Why am I tending to a digital garden?

1. Heisenberg was wrong
    - TODO: expand

1. I keep editing my blog posts
    - plant a seed in garden
    - nurture; let it grow

1. Day 1 - Too many ideas/projects; Day 2 - no idea/project
    - list down that absurd idea
    - can't do ADR for life decisions

1. Learning in public??
    - people push/motivate/question you
