Solution should be defined in top down approach from:
Outcomes - end goal (solution for the problem) Behavior - what behaviors you would exhibit to reach outcome Insights - what insights you need to have to exhibit behaviors Findings Data Going this approach lets you think about the problem from a top-down perspective instead of baising you with the data that you have.</description></item><item><title>Developing Game Engine</title><link>https://www.hrmnjt.dev/posts/vault/sttp.thoughts.external.developing-game-engine/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.hrmnjt.dev/posts/vault/sttp.thoughts.external.developing-game-engine/</guid><description>https://www.haroldserrano.com/blog/how-do-i-build-a-game-engine

The interview process is designed to provide a signal on two things:
Does the candidate meets the job requirement and have the required skills, Will the candidate be an excellent future colleague? When having discussions itâ€™s easier to get signals like:
Do they ask clarifying questions when they don&amp;rsquo;t feel judged Do they make suggestions without feeling scared Do they accept direction/feedback and process it Do they verbalize what they think because they are not scared to give a wrong answer How Start with:</description></item><item><title>Experiments</title><link>https://www.hrmnjt.dev/posts/vault/sttp.code.experiments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.hrmnjt.dev/posts/vault/sttp.code.experiments/</guid><description/></item><item><title>External</title><link>https://www.hrmnjt.dev/posts/vault/sttp.thoughts.external/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.hrmnjt.dev/posts/vault/sttp.thoughts.external/</guid><description/></item><item><title>GitHub Login</title><link>https://www.hrmnjt.dev/posts/vault/sttp.code.geekmarks.github-login/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.hrmnjt.dev/posts/vault/sttp.code.geekmarks.github-login/</guid><description>#TODO</description></item><item><title>IETF rfc3</title><link>https://www.hrmnjt.dev/posts/vault/sttp.thoughts.external.rfc3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.hrmnjt.dev/posts/vault/sttp.thoughts.external.rfc3/</guid><description>Source: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3
CONTENT
The content of a NWG note may be any thought, suggestion, etc. related to the HOST software or other aspect of the network. Notes are encouraged to be timely rather than polished. Philosophical positions without examples or other specifics, specific suggestions or implementation techniques without introductory or background explication, and explicit questions without any attempted answers are all acceptable. The minimum length for a NWG note is one sentence.</description></item><item><title>Installing Confluent</title><link>https://www.hrmnjt.dev/posts/vault/sttp.code.confluent-learning.installing-confluent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.hrmnjt.dev/posts/vault/sttp.code.confluent-learning.installing-confluent/</guid><description>All installations below are for Ubuntu

RFC abbv. Request For Comments (a.k.a. RFD abbv. Request For Discussion) is a age old concept which teams follow to improve collaboration culture for taking decisions. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how the idea for RFC came to be but most of the texts I&amp;rsquo;ve read link this to [[sttp.thoughts.external.rfc3]] by IETF. The concept for RFCs are to enable comments as in open source culture to align instead of getting concensus.</description></item><item><title>Publishing GitHub Pages Primer</title><link>https://www.hrmnjt.dev/posts/vault/sttp.code.experiments.publishing-github-pages-primer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.hrmnjt.dev/posts/vault/sttp.code.experiments.publishing-github-pages-primer/</guid><description>Github Pages (Primer theme) is a cool and easy way to publish a bunch of markdown files in a repository to look like a minimal and clean webpage.

Performance Tuning Principles
Make some part of your computation faster Don&amp;rsquo;t do what you don&amp;rsquo;t need to do Don&amp;rsquo;t do again what you have already done Use more resources: parallelise &amp;amp; distribute Executor is idle - improve driver computation
file listing &amp;amp; split computation e.g. S3 file listing will take lot of time Loading Hive table from Spark e.g. write data = write data to temporary location + write data from temporary location (hadoop) to hive df.</description></item><item><title>sttp and Digital Garden</title><link>https://www.hrmnjt.dev/posts/vault/sttp.about.garden/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.hrmnjt.dev/posts/vault/sttp.about.garden/</guid><description>In order to explain, the structure of this about section is like FAQs, or rather like In-Frequently Asked Question (iFAQs) as I call it.

What is sttp? Secure Thought Transfer Protocol (abbr. sttp) is raw stream of thoughts. More accurately, sttp is a collection of loosely held opinions/thoughts (in form of notes) that I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make sense of. It is also an anchor for me to go back in time, incercept the thought and refine it based on present context.</description></item><item><title>sttp://</title><link>https://www.hrmnjt.dev/posts/vault/sttp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.hrmnjt.dev/posts/vault/sttp/</guid><description>Hello World!
