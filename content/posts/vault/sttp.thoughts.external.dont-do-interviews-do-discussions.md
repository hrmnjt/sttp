The interview process is designed to provide a signal on two things:
1. Does the candidate meets the job requirement and have the required skills,
1. Will the candidate be an excellent future colleague?


When having discussions itâ€™s easier to get signals like:
- Do they ask clarifying questions when they don't feel judged
- Do they make suggestions without feeling scared
- Do they accept direction/feedback and process it
- Do they verbalize what they think because they are not scared to give a wrong answer

## How

Start with:
- Let's use this time to discuss a few interesting problems; let's assume we are colleagues and discussing this problem


Use "We" instead of "you" because it feels more inclusive and it is


Sitting on the same side of the table or standing next to them when whiteboarding instead of sitting at the desk
