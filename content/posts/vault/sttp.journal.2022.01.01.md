## Structure going ahead

Below could be the structure for the journal notes going ahead. Maybe it might be nicer to create a template and schema for this setup, post reading and understanding those dendron concepts.

```markdown
## Open Source

#### Project 1
- update 1
- update 2
- ...

#### Project 2

## Reading

## Ideas
- new idea or additional thoughts 1
- new idea or additional thoughts 2

## Upcoming todo

## Other things
- event 1
- event 2
```


## Open source

#### sttp 
- Setup the base project and `dendron`-`hugo` setup with pre-existing theme. Backlog of items to improve in the current setup is huge but instead of doing it with the Hugo theme it seems better to do a design and decide which features should land on current Hugo setup vs. on the custom personal exobrain
- Setup base project to track the open items that might not be tracked else where. I should plan an organization strategy and reach a place where I can define milestones
- Setup journal to document daily events to reach milestones

## Upcoming todo
- [ ] Setup schema and template for daily journal

## Ideas

- [[sttp.code.sttp]]
- [[sttp.code.vam]]
- [[sttp.code.rfc-tooling]]
- [[sttp.code.learn.confluent]]

## Other things

- It rained a lot this morning and afternoon. Expo and/or other plans were no-go
- Watched The Good Doctor - S03 is good; better than S02; characters are moving ahead in their journeys instead of usual drama; there is still a lot of drama that happens in the hospital though; good writing though - characters and cases are realistic compared to S02.
- Watched [83](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7518786/)
  - Good movie; less drama; more story and one of the most subtle Bollywood documentaries I've watched
  - Stories about each individual were amazing (I'm not sure how many are fictious)
