## (Context and) Why?

My educational background is in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. My career has me take multiple roles around data - data scientist, data engineer both individual contributor and technically managing team. I've ended up here because sheer interest in technology and hacking my way though logic, unpythonic python and some unconventional technologies.

Recently I've been thinking about how I want to [[develop my career as a M-shaped engineer|sttp.thoughts.m-shaped-engineer]]. I would want to break this down into two streams:
- **fundamentals** - basic low-level details about programming languages, data structures and algorithms, compilers, networks, operating systems etc.
- **applied computer science** - improve my day-to-day work with applying the fundamentals 

I realize this is a long journey and I wanted to start with Go (golang) as a language as many have suggested to me. While learning Go, I wanted to make notes about things that I would want to remember when I'm applying this knowledge. Hence this section.

## (Process and) How?

I'll basically start with [Golang Docs](https://go.dev/doc/) and [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1) - as basic as it can get.

In the process, I'll link additional sites and references that I found and maybe link more details about application or open questions about the topic. I'm hoping I'll get to answer the question with a use case at a later point of time.

Interesting reads that I ought to come back and understand in detail are:
- [[sttp.thoughts.external.go-proverbs]]
- [[sttp.thoughts.external.json-to-go]]
- [[sttp.thoughts.external.go-by-example]]
