## When to Ask for Help: The 3-Hour Limit

> Before I ask for help, I like to ask myself:
> - Have I given this my best shot within reason?
- Are there any obvious angles I haven’t thought of?
- Are there major resources I’ve forgotten to check?
- Do I want to keep working on this because it’s the right thing for the group goal, or because I want to be the one who solves it?

> People who tend to wait too long to ask for help also tend to have a lot of grit, which is an intense perseverance and commitment to goals. This is mostly a wonderful quality, but it’s not without its pitfalls.

## How to Ask for Help

> - Ask directly for help
- Give some context on the problem
- Tell them what you’ve already tried or how to reproduce it (this will short-circuit your fears of looking lazy or foolish)
- Ask them what they would try next
- Provide them code or a sandbox
- Thank them
