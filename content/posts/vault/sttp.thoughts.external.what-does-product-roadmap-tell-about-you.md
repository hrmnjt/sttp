- All products starts with something simple; little perfect thing; grows with tractions
- Everything increases together
    - feature request
    - bugs
    - users
    - use-cases
    - ideas
    - opportunities
    - types of users
    - teammates
    - product requests
- Roadmap: company's true goals
- Key ingredients
    - iterate on product
    - new ideas
        - are counterintuitive
            - customers aren't asking
            - dismissed as toys
            - likely to fail
            - impossible to justify
            - no precedent
        - if you want to innovate
            - instill in your team
            - ensure it is safe to try things
            - measure success for new ideas
            - ensure new ideas can be explored without rationalization
                - rationalization is a meat grinder
                - rationalization beats the shit out of new ideas - justify, sanity check, etc.
    - customer problems
        - customer feedback is tricky
            - customers have expertise
            - always speak in terms of pre-concieved solution
            - can't predict future behavior
            - over-state and under-state importance
    - features to help scale
    - improve quality
        - understand
            - quality - how well executed is it today
            - importance - how important in workflow is it
            - satisfaction - how happy are customers using your product
            - frequency - how often do they use it
- roadmap formula changes over time
    - ratio - `new-ideas:improve-quality:customer-problems:product-iteration`
    - first you make it
    - then you improve it
    - then iterate and solve problem
