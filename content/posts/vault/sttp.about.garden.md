In order to explain, the structure of this about section is like FAQs, or rather like In-Frequently Asked Question (iFAQs) as I call it. Please read through.

## What is `sttp`?

Secure Thought Transfer Protocol (abbr. `sttp`) is raw stream of thoughts. More accurately, `sttp` is a collection of loosely held opinions/thoughts (in form of notes) that I'm trying to make sense of. It is also an anchor for me to go back in time, incercept the thought and refine it based on present context.

Most of the notes (called seeds in garden) might not make sense until they start budding and become evergreen. Unapologetically, I would say they are not supposed to make sense as they are not finalized or permanent.

## Why does it resemble HTTP?

Years ago, a collegue of mine, [Shashwat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shashwat-kashyap-ab7375a2/) and I were having the casual chat about shower thoughts and protocols. This is after a long day of boring work when you get to actually talk about something that you are passionate about, something that moves you. At this time, I used to send daily mails to our team with top 5 shower thoughts (minus NSFW) so that people might start their day with something to enjoy and smile about.

We discussed how cool would be it to name the email to be called STTP (pun on HTTP) where you are securely transfering (shower) thoughts to people.

When I was starting to create a digital garden, it was an extension of the same philosophy of shower thoughts. A digital garden for me is extending the shower thought beyond the actual shower. It adds an action element to it. Hence, it was apt to name it `sttp://secure-thought-transfer-protocol`.

## How are you tending to your garden?

I'm right now experimenting with [Dendron](https://wiki.dendron.so). It ticks a lot of boxes for me and aligns with the idea of note taking in your code editor i.e. VSCode for me. The project is in active development phase and has a lot of features which are maturing over time.

The best part about it is being open source and establishing a community which fosters knowledge management regardless of the tool which is being used. I'm part of their active community and am trying to contribute to the project as well. In the process I'm [[dogfooding|sttp.thoughts.external.dogfooding]] with Dendron.

This site is published by seeds planted in Dendron and hosted via Github Pages. This way I don't have to manage the web nerdery and go back to just think with writing.

## But isn't digital garden a blog?

It is. In a way. Or I would say a blog is a curated essay or article which was once a seed in digital garden. A garden is more raw in nature and makes me shed my perfectionist bias (or compulsion) for writing.

There are people out there who can explain this much better than me e.g. [Maggie](https://twitter.com/Mappletons) has explained [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). Tom Critchlow writes about [Building Digital Garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/). 

Also there are lot of public gardens that can show a different version or taste to this.
