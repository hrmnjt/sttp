There are two reason to tend your digital garden

1. You care; you want to make your garden evergreen
1. You have a new seed that needs place in your garden

There might be another reason i.e. I'm lost; which to me is extension of 1st reason where being lost you have come to your garden to streamline your previous thoughts or dwell upon them. My strategy for tending to garden differs for the above scenarios. For the 1st reason you need to think broader and shallow and for the 2nd you need to go deeper and focus.

## When I'm caring my your garden

I open a random `thoughts` note and question myself - **Does this note deserve to stay?**. Post, which it is the decision tree below which drives the next outcome.

## When I've a new thought to record or a seed to plant

I create a new `thoughts` note and start adding details. 
- If I'm thinking about a topic then I follow the [Amoeba pattern](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/e780000d-c784-4945-8e42-35218a3ecf10/) i.e. create a huge note until the heirarchy becomes clear and note can be broken off into smaller individual chunks.
- If I'm capturing thoughts while reading a book/article, watching a video or attending a meeting, then I keep writing down and fix the note post that event is complete.

These notes are big reason you come back to your digital garden for the 1st reason to create a closed loop.
