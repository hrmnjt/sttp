## Context - what are we talking about?

RFC abbv. Request For Comments (a.k.a. RFD abbv. Request For Discussion) is a age old concept which teams follow to improve collaboration culture for taking decisions. I'm not sure how the idea for RFC came to be but most of the texts I've read link this to [[sttp.thoughts.external.rfc3]] by IETF. The concept for RFCs are to enable comments as in open source culture to align instead of getting concensus. Comments and discussions are also ways of engaging with community to understand concerns and approach/solutions.

ADR abbv. Architecture Decision Records are similar concept that has its root with Solution Architecture lays down similar fundamentals but is more directive in nature with structure outline as below
- problem context
- options that can provide solution
- decision is taken to choose one solution among others available
