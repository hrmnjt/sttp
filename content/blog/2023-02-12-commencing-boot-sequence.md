Hello, world!

Boot Sequence is the set of instructions that get the computers running when we 
press the power button. For example in Linux, it is generally first is the BIOS 
starting up MBR. MBR runs GRUB which executes Kernel which executes init 
sequence which executes runlevel programs. I'm not sure of all the things that 
happen in a sequence, but that content is probably for next post. For me and 
this website though, as the catchy title says, this is the first set of step 
which hopefully is going to setup the pattern of blogging for me.

After a lot of yak-shaving, I'm setting up the blog with Zola as a SSG.
Templates, styling and other changes might be added as part of upcoming 
updates. My bucket list for this website is huge but there are a few changes 
that I forsee coming:
- basic styling
- deploy
- fix content view - root, section, blog
- content navigation
- search for content
- opengraph links
- deep-linking and memex
- creating a feed (atom, json)
- sitemaps, robots.txt, 404 page, archive

See you around!
