Right now, my coding workflow can be summarized as furious alt-tab between
Firefox, Sublime Text and iterm2 and maxing out on keyboard shortcuts for all
three of them. I always had the urge to ditch Sublime as well and move to my
own personalized development environment but setting up neovim and leaving the
comfort of Sublime felt like unnecessary pressure for me. In order to get
hooked on Vim motions I switched to vim-bindings on Sublime Text and found
myself using them a lot instead of Sublime shortcuts which don't feel very 
natural and intuitive anymore. But my range was very little; I'm not using a
lot of what is possible; a lot of what can be good and intuitive.

So... I went online and searched for a cheatsheet - a reference which I would
keep open and alt-tab to it when I need to look into a handy way of doing
something in neovim. I found and recommend
[Advanced Vim Cheatsheet](https://thingsfittogether.com/product/vim-cheat-sheet-advanced-digital-download/)
which is not free but amazing. But this approach was counter productive because
now I have Sublime + Firefox + iterm2 + Preview open on my laptop which is 2
more applications I want to have open when coding.

So... I created a terminal reference for most important keymaps that I want to
worry about with space for some more that I can add later.

and here is the [Github repository](https://github.com/hrmnjt/vim-cheatsheet/)
which has has the source code for the cheatsheet. To open the monopic file, you
might need [Monodraw](https://monodraw.helftone.com/) which is what I used to
create the cheatsheet.
