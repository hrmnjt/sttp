The term "PBE" is a play on the an acronym IDE i.e. Integrated Development 
Environment. The core idea of the post to check on all personalizations I wanted
to do on this blogging setup and also stay as reference to how certain elements
on the website might behave.

### why the hell did it take you 8 months?

![Ackchyually](/img/ackchyually.png)

It did not. After I wrote the first post, I started burning my energy on my day
job which was interesting and hectic to say the least. There were lot of things
for me to learn and a lot of time was spent fixing stuff for work. Meanwhile, my
development workflow has changed a lot
- moved to todo.txt for tracking tasks (from paper notes)
- started a custom daily log setup with bash magic
- stopped using pinboard and hacked some bash to create a terminal bookmark-er
- bash-ed time-logging chores required at work to reduce cognitive load

At this point though, all these have become a mush and need maintenance, so I'm
trying to revive the blog and in a devlog approach fix these mushy items into
clean interfaces which allow me to go faster on my day to day.

### first, basic styling

When I started this website, I used Zola Overview [^1] to get started with the
base content and styling which is the rudimentary setup that one should ideally
start their personalization journey from. I've always admired minimalistic
portfolio/websites of Danluu [^2], Tom MacWright [^3] and Xe Iaso [^4]. This 
also helps me on my inherent dislike for tinkering CSS. Most of the times I want
to the bare minimum required to get it working. So, it was but natural for me 
to fork the CSS required on this site from "even better motherf***ing 
site" [^5].

So basically added below and it looks good.

```css
body {
    background: #f2f2f2;
    color: #444444;
    line-height: 1.6;
    font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
    font-size: 16px;
    margin: 5% auto;
    max-width: 73%;
}
a {
    border-bottom: 1px solid #444444;
    color: #444444;
    text-decoration: none;
}
```

### deploy when I push

I use Cloudflare DNS to manage the domain `hrmnjt.dev` and there were 2 easy
options for me to run a continuous deployment flow - Github Actions + Github 
Pages or Cloudflare Pages. I chose latter to try this out. Steps that one has
to follow are from Cloudflare Pages Docs [^6]. It executes the build process on
every commit and creates a staging and production link [^7].

### navigation

Zola has sane and easy defaults for `index`, `section` and `page` templates and
at this point of time I don't think I need anything more than this for 
content on this website. This means navigation can be super simple and easy.

Right now, we have three places to navigate to
- `/` which uses `index` template and routes to root of website
- `/blog` which uses `section` template and routes to all post list
- `/blog/post1` which uses `page` template and routes to individual post. This
is also what I suppose will be centerpiece.

### feed, sitemap, robot.txt, 404 page

Zola already solves for most of this as out of box options and this was simplest
to solve. Just put a few lines of code here and there and you get most of this
working very well.

### fix CSS for all markdown syntax

This article offers a sample of basic Markdown syntax that can be used in Zola content files, also it shows if basic HTML elements are decorated with CSS in a Zola theme.

# Headings

The following HTML `<h1>`—`<h6>` elements represent six levels of section
headings. `<h1>` is the highest section level while `<h6>` is the lowest.

# Blockquotes

The blockquote element represents content that is quoted from another source,
optionally with a citation which must be within a `footer` or `cite` element,
and optionally with in-line changes such as annotations and abbreviations.

## Blockquote no attribution

> Tiam, ad mint andaepu dandae nostion secatur sequo quae.
> **Note** that you can use *Markdown syntax* within a blockquote.

## Blockquote with attribution

> Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.<br>
> — <cite>Rob Pike[^1]</cite>

> All men by nature desire to know.<br>
> ― <cite>Aristotle[^2]</cite>

> Power comes in response to a need, not a desire.<br>

## Large table within figure tag

Surround very Large tables with `<figure></figure>` so they can scroll horizontally.
<figure>

## Navs

Site primary menu is created by nesting the nav under a header tag. Refer to the top of this site for an example.

If the nav tag is under the main tag instead of the header tag then the links will have a border:

<header>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#">&#60; Previous</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Next &#62;</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
</header>
