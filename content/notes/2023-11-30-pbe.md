The term "PBE" is a play on the an acronym IDE i.e. Integrated Development
Environment and abbreviation for "personalized blogging environment". The core
idea of the post to check on all personalizations I wanted to do on this
blogging setup and also stay as reference to how certain elements on the
website might behave.

It did not. After I wrote the first post, I started burning my energy on my day
job which was interesting and hectic to say the least. There were lot of things
for me to learn and a lot of time was spent fixing stuff for work. Meanwhile, my
development workflow has changed a lot
- moved to todo.txt for tracking tasks (from paper notes)
- started a custom daily log setup with bash magic
- stopped using pinboard and hacked some bash to create a terminal bookmark-er
- bash-ed time-logging chores required at work to reduce cognitive load

At this point though, all these have become a mush and need maintenance, so I'm
trying to revive the blog and in a devlog approach fix these mushy items into
clean interfaces which allow me to go faster on my day to day.

> i wonder if the site wasn't as raw?

When I started this website, I used Zola Overview [^1] to get started with the
base content and styling which is the rudimentary setup that one should ideally
start their personalization journey from. I've always admired minimalistic
portfolio/websites[^2] of Danluu, Tom MacWright and Xe Iaso. (I want to confess
that I avoid tinkering CSS as much as possible). I leaned towards styling from
"even better motherf***ing site" [^3] with a few tweaks; added below and it
looks good.

```css
body {
    background: #f2f2f2;
    color: #444444;
    line-height: 1.6;
    font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
    font-size: 16px;
    margin: 5% auto;
    max-width: 73%;
}
a {
    border-bottom: 1px solid #444444;
    color: #444444;
    text-decoration: none;
}
```

> i wonder if site would refresh when I push push

I use Cloudflare DNS to manage the domain `hrmnjt.dev` and there were 2 easy
options for me to run a continuous deployment flow - Github Actions + Github
Pages or Cloudflare Pages. I chose latter to try this out. Steps that one has
to follow are from Cloudflare Pages Docs. It executes the build process on
every commit and creates a staging and production link [^4].

> i wonder if there was a better way to find content

Zola has sane and easy defaults for `index`, `section` and `page` templates and
at this point of time I don't think I need anything more than this for
content on this website. This means navigation can be super simple and easy.

Right now, we have three places to navigate to
- `/` which uses `index` template and routes to root of website
- `/blog` which uses `section` template and routes to all post list
- `/blog/post1` which uses `page` template and routes to individual post. This
is also what I suppose will be centerpiece.

> is there a feed, sitemap? what happens on a random url? will this appear on
google search?

Zola already solves for most of above as out-of-box options. Feed, sitemap and
robot.txt are default generated if configured based on documentation[^5]. Adding
these options and few lines of code in templates made it easy to finish this
item from checklist.

Site is functional, blogs are readable and this is a good target for me to get going with some actual blog ideas which are pending.

## now, a visual facelift

Before yesterday, I've had a hate-hate relationship with CSS. I never gave it a
serious chance to CSS and it in return, never worked well with me. We have
started understanding each other since yesterday. I started exploring with the
aim to improve visual design for the website and make it look clean and crisp.

I started with an easy one - favicon. Favicons are not a big deal unless you
have 200 tabs open on a browser window. It creates a minimalistic branding
which goes a long way especially when "thinking fast". I highly recommend
favicon.io generator[^6] which takes in simple inputs to create assets and
provides documentation about enabling the favicons.

As I was going through `<meta>` tags for website, I quickly added theme
color[^7] which makes android (and in some case desktop) view cohesive. Again,
like the favicon, theme colors are underrated for the value they provide to
subconscious design.

As for other things related to `<meta>` tags, OpenGraph Protocol makes the
blog sharing look good on most platforms. With `og:title`, `og:description`,
`og:url` and `og:image` most of the social platforms create a card layout to
show shared content in a better way. Going ahead I can add an `og:image` per
post for customization. For next fun "side project", I plan on using an LLM to
generate an image for each post.

Next set of improvements are towards making the CSS for all significant HTML
tags that get generated based on my markdown usage. This involves headings,
links, images, blockquotes, tables and codeblocks. While I was at it, I made
some minor changes to website layout which improves container width, mobile
view for website, top navigation, footer and section pages.

I'm very happy with way the website looks right now and I want to focus on
getting to adding good content in near future.
