⚠️ **Time Capsule Alert!** ⚠️

This post is a digital fossil excavated from my ancient blog archives. Like finding your embarrassing high school photos, this content represents Past Me™ (who knew significantly less than Current Me).

Side effects may include: broken links, missing images, and opinions I've since upgraded. My brain has received several critical software updates since writing this.

# Side project idea list - I

Recently, I've been thinking about a few things to build, learn and publish. Some of them for pure joy, some because I started learning some concepts and had an encounter.

I'm quickly going to note them down and come back to these ASAP as possible. Like Michael Scott says.

- **Git backed notes** - already did a microblog few days back, need some time to think in detail
- **Scala REPL based language learning** - imagine a REPL lines to explain the Scala language concept. It could be good way to learn the concept and share it with others.
  Bonus points: I'll build a reference for myself
- **Ansible repository** - create a simple hadoop cluster with Zookeeper, HDFS, Spark and use Ambari or similar to manage this. Setup all the services using Ansible
- **Latex resume** - how fun would it be to include a resume to my about page.
  Bonus points: Learn Latex as a by-product
- **Make a Git basics slides** - also make the slides fun to read with the puns and simplicity
  Bonus points: Use the pre-historic Mu Sigma times Git slides I made for this purpose

I've too less time in life. Hope to squeeze awesome time this holiday season.
