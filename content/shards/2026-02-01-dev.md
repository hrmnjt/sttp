I saw [Prime's My Dev Setup Is Better Than Yours](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/developer-productivity-v2/introduction/)
earlier this year and got inspired by it. I tried to [mock it](https://github.com/hrmnjt/dev/tree/0.0.1)
but that didn't go too far.

Also, last year I changed jobs, which implied a new laptop and new vigor to
create my "dev setup". But this time, I couldn't invest time into adding my
features and started looking for tools that would fix this for me instead. I
found plenty of them, some I had tried earlier and some new ones as well.
Instead of doing a "classic Harman's analysis" (which is more like 
analysis-paralysis) I went ahead and chose `stow` and wanted to see the mileage
I will get with it. Overtime I added `just` to the mix and I guess I'm super
happy about how it looks. There are too many things I can improve, but that goes
for so many other things in my life.

So behold, [sudo make me a sandwich](https://github.com/hrmnjt/dev) or my dev
setup, which is the best for me and might not work for you at all. But future
Harman will for sure thank current Harman (epoch: 1769955510) for organizing
the dev setup and writing a few words about it.

In a nutshell:
- `brew bundle` manages the bottles and casks that I need
- `just` reduces the number of bash script needed
- `stow` manages the dotfiles

There are a lot of things I want to improve though. And maybe I'll stop being
lazy and do them sometime in future.
