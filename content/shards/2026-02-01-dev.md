I saw [Prime's My Dev Setup Is Better Than Yours][1] earlier this year and got
inspired by it. I tried to [mock it][mockdev] but that didn't go too far. I
abandoned it and never got serious about it. If you haven't seen or heard about
it, the gist is (a) Prime shows an approach that works for him and (b) he
explains his dev setup is better than mine because it's his; and it works for
him and because it is so custom-made for himself, it makes him productive.

Last year I changed jobs, which implied a new laptop and new vigor to
create my "dev setup". But this time, I couldn't invest time into adding my
features and started looking for tools that would fix this for me instead. I
found plenty of them, some I had tried earlier and some new ones as well.
Instead of doing a "classic Harman's analysis" (which is more like 
analysis-paralysis) I went ahead and chose `stow` and wanted to see the mileage
I will get with it. Overtime I added `just` to the mix and I guess I'm super
happy about how it looks. There are too many things I can improve, but that goes
for so many other things in my life.

So behold, [sudo make me a sandwich](https://github.com/hrmnjt/dev) or my dev
setup, which is the best for me and might not work for you at all. But future
Harman will for sure thank current Harman (epoch: 1769955510) for organizing
the dev setup and writing a few words about it. It's not perfect but its mine.

In a nutshell:
- `brew bundle` manages the bottles and casks that I need
- `just` reduces the number of bash script needed
- `stow` manages the dotfiles

There are a lot of things I want to improve though. And maybe I'll stop being
lazy and do them sometime in future.

**Improvement 1: simpler bootstrap steps**: As of [02d2867][02d2867], the
bootstrap requires me to install homebrew, install `just` and `stow` using
homebrew, clone this repo, define `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`[^1], and install required
software using `brew bundle` and configure most of them with `stow`. That
leaves out folder structure for Git and SSH key generation for Github.

If I spend some energy learning `make` and its idiosyncracies, I can ditch
`just`. And if I write a shell script to overwrite partially or completely the
`.config` that I create, I can ditch `stow`. Since my dev setup is on a public
Github repo (and will be public forever, I guess), can clone it using HTTPS for
the first time on `/tmp` directory and just go brrr with the setup e.g. to
create `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, folder structure for Git, `brew bundle` and force
updating dotfiles.

Since I don't buy a Macbook so often, this improvement doesn't provide the ROI
required.

[^1]: While writing this post I learned that, Apple/NeXTSTEP conventions
(circa:1989) predate XDG Base Directory specifications (circa:2003) and latter
was created to solve the chaos in Linux ecosystem and has community-driven
voluntary enforcement. Since, I run Linux on servers, I prefer to follow this
convention and want to do the same on my MacOS machines for low cognitive load.

**Improvement 2: make it work for my servers too**: I don't buy Macbooks too
often, but I create and delete Linux servers too often. Right now, my setup
implies only local setup and not servers. I still largely use Claude Code on my
server to set them up and manage installations. Solving this problem will
actually make me saner. I've some ideas where I can test them up with ephemeral
machines[^2]

[^2]: [exe.dev](https://exe.dev/) and [Sprites](https://sprites.dev/) are 2 new
projects that I learnt about last week and both of them seem super interesting
to run and re-run random scripts to refine my dev setup with ease.

**Improvement 3: missing configurations**: I use `ripgrep`, `fzf`, `direnv` and
many more other tools but I use them raw. I should spend some time and integrate
`fzf` well into the workflow instead of manually adding flags.

**Improvement 4: smaller neovim configuration**: Right now, I use
`kickstart.nvim` and I've been using it for some time. I understand neovim well
enough to use a simpler and modular neovim configuration. But I've been too lazy
to get to doing this.

I believe there are many more improvements that I believe can be done, which I
can't think about right now. 2025 Harman would have created a list of TODOs
which would give him "Phantom Obligation"[^3]. But, instead I chose to dump them
here and address it when I address it.

[^3]: I read this amazing article about feed readers UX creating a sense of
urgency to read an article and coin the word that suits this behavior I've
demonstrated in past. [Phantom Obligation](https://www.terrygodier.com/phantom-obligation)
