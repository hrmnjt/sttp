Dubai, or should I say UAE have had an ever long issue with VoIP. Club it with
the costly telecom plans compared to other countries, it becomes borderline
impossible to talk to people back in India.

People generally resort to VPN, but I find that to be a very un-natural way of
making calls. Mind you, I'm very pro-VPN. In fact, I like the improved privacy
and have fiddled with OpenVPN back in Bangalore days a lot.

TBH, having VPN established on your phone or laptop just to make a call back
home feels weird and unstable. It is illegal to that; even if that were not the
case it is a dependency. And there is the added disadvantage that VPN it
blocked as well, which result in loss of bandwidth, and effects the VoIP.

## What happens in my thought
> VoIP service is not blocked as a capability. You can still recieve WhatsApp
calls for example (but you would not be able to talk)

> The applications can't be blocked by tampering with the app distribution
(creating regional app distribution channels) and the solution would not scale
as there are 172 countries and some or the other country would make an app
which couldn't be controlled

> The internet access (through telcoms) can though restrict these services
based on the IPs required for the VoIP services to run. But this would again
be not scalable as the application IPs can change really easily (that also
suggests me to check how does the parental control and similar feature work)

> If all kinds of VoIP services work on certains ports - such as HTTPS 443,
HTTP 80 etc. one way to block all the connectivity would be block all the ports

> Doing a country wide parental control is not easy. Security team must be
working really hard to make this possible.

I think this is very backwards and have more disadvantageous than it improves
security
- Visitors would want to show loved ones back home good things about Dubai and
they can't because they can't do a video call
- Expats who decided to stay here long term need to find new ways of breaking
the law using VPN and new, unauthorized applications and software
- It would be considerable amount of effort required to maintain this block
- Startups are effected a lot, especially the remote culture
- The allowed applications that enable this service even at a cost are not good
to be minimum, they are full of ads to push people away

With so many concerns, it seems rather obvious that there would be more
content-fullness and improvements by allowing VoIP than by blocking it for
whole public. Maybe, I should understand this deeper and talk to poeple who
know more about why and how this started.

Allowing Totok and this article provoked this train of thought -
