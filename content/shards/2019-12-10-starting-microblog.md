⚠️ **Time Capsule Alert!** ⚠️

This post is a digital fossil excavated from my ancient blog archives. Like finding your embarrassing high school photos, this content represents Past Me™ (who knew significantly less than Current Me).

Side effects may include: broken links, missing images, and opinions I've since upgraded. My brain has received several critical software updates since writing this.

For the latest version of my thoughts (now with 73% fewer bugs!), please check out my more recent posts.

## Concern 1: I don't like posting updates to Twitter. Why? Because:
- I'm a slow thinker
- I'm very crude in my thoughts
- I hate the infamous Imposter Syndrome, which I think is rooted somehow on
social media
- I hate broadcasting personal details which are not of importance to the
whole world

What I do on Twitter is - read a lot of good stuff (among rants, jokes, memes
and related stuff), learn about new trends and retweet things which appeal.

## Concern 2: I fail on keeping up with frequent blogging
When I originally thought of the idea for the blog, I was solving for some
problems. You can read the blog post -
[Why I started writing?](https://hrmn.in/blog/why-did-i-start-writing/) for
more details. TL,DR: I wanted to document interesting thoughts in a secure way
without broadcasting the personal effects.

How does blog overcome or try to overcome the concerns I have for Twitter?
- Till I'm famous or I have an awesome SEO for my blog, updates to my blog are
practically public without someone noticing it
- I don't have to follow something or quote someone or act like someone when
I'm blogging which should be an original idea

Blogging was a boon instantly - it helped me articulate things better and
taught me how to remove clutter from thoughts and isolate concerns. It also
taught me simplicity in thoughts and UI/UX is powerful. I redesigned my blog
to show that effect

> But the original problem still remained. I was not blogging frequently and
was going for perfection of blog posts. The another big problem with blogging
weekly meant doing that on Weekend, which is impossible unless there is
discipline.

## Not so much of a concern but ....
I'm not on Facebook. I'm on LinkedIn an hour per week. I'm on Instagram lesser
than LinkedIn (to converse with Snigdha) and I don't even want to get started
with any blogging site, social site.

And even if I were doing better on these platforms, it would be non-issue and
similar to Twitter.

# Microblog is born

I think few of the below, if not all are going to happen

**I can put content without rationale**
I have crude thoughts, Okay! No longer a concern. I found an awesome link -
this is my clipboard. I have an unfinished idea - here it can be thrown.

**I will follow a routine**
Since, I don't have to adhere to a certain level of thought. I can post more
frequently - weekly, for sure; daily, most likely; hourly, maybe; realtime feed
- watch out brainwaves.

**I don't loose track of thoughts**
What this might also enable is the train of thoughts that is sometimes not
complete, not thought thoroughly or interrupted by another interesting one.
Like Elizabeth Gilbert says, Genius doesn't happen to you all the time. So I'm
going to note these things and have them accessible all the while

Let's see where this goes. No promises and finger crossed!
