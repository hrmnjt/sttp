title: "Why Writing Rough Drafts Matters"

I've been thinking about the friction in writing and publishing lately. Many of us (myself included) often get stuck in an endless cycle of editing and refinement, trying to achieve perfection before sharing our thoughts with the world[^1].

The core idea behind publishing rough drafts or "shards" is to reduce this activation energy. By accepting that our writing doesn't need to be polished to be valuable, we can share more frequently and iterate based on feedback.

> I want to add this for the sake of testing this

```gitconfig
# ~/.config/git/config

# `user.name` and `user.email` import for work configuration
[includeIf "gitdir:~/code/github.com/maf/"]
    path = ~/.config/git/config.maf

# `user.name` and `user.email` import for personal configuration
[includeIf "gitdir:~/code/github.com/hrmnjt/"]
    path = ~/.config/git/config.hrmnjt

# `user.name` and `user.email` import for personal configuration
[includeIf "gitdir:~/code/git.sr.ht/hrmnjt/"]
    path = ~/.config/git/config.hrmnjt
```

```python
subprocess.run(['duckdb', '-init', temp_file_path], check=True)
```


lets check `how inline code block` looks like


```python
def example_function(x):
    # This is a comment
    print("Hello, world!")
    return x * 42
```

```javascript
function exampleFunction(x) {
    // This is a comment
    console.log("Hello, world!");
    return x * 42;
}
```

## Some Technical Notes

I built this blog using a minimal Hugo setup with no theme, using system fonts and minimal CSS[^2]. The external links (like this one to [Patrick Collison's blog](https://patrickcollison.com)) are automatically marked with an arrow.

[^1]: This is something both [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/essay.html) and [Dan Luu](https://danluu.com/writing-non-advice/) have written about extensively.

[^2]: Inspired by blogs like [Gwern's site](https://gwern.net/about/design), which proves that simple HTML and CSS can create highly readable experiences.
