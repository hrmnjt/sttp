Back story: When I read "How fast is your shell?" [^1] by Thorsten Ball, 
almost an year ago, I immediately jumped my seat to check my shell latency. I
use `zsh` as daily driver, not because of choice, but rather because it comes as
default shell on MacOS. When I started my career, choice of shell was an unknown
unknown for me. I didn't know that since macOS Catalina, Apple switched from
`bash` to `zsh` to avoid licensing obligations of GPLv3 for newer versions of
`bash`. I was also not aware of POSIX compliance of shells and maintaining
portability for scripts to run anywhere. Shell scripts was as means to an end
and it worked. Over the years, I'm more inclined to terminal based interfaces
and reading the article struck a chord somewhere deep and I was compelled to
fix my shell startup time.

I haven't version controlled my dotfiles on current system and hence, I don't
have the benchmarks documented but from what I remember when I started with the
optimization, my shell would take ~700ms to start; which was a horrible number.
My goal was to get below ~100ms and I used below command to check after
stripping out parts of my `~/.zshrc`.

```sh
for i in $(seq 1 10); do time $SHELL -i -c exit; done
# ~700ms before optimizations
# now, ~330ms
#$SHELL -i -c exit  0.19s user 0.12s system 81% cpu 0.374 total
#$SHELL -i -c exit  0.18s user 0.10s system 88% cpu 0.323 total
#$SHELL -i -c exit  0.18s user 0.10s system 87% cpu 0.325 total
#$SHELL -i -c exit  0.18s user 0.10s system 86% cpu 0.329 total
#$SHELL -i -c exit  0.18s user 0.10s system 86% cpu 0.330 total
#$SHELL -i -c exit  0.18s user 0.10s system 85% cpu 0.335 total
#$SHELL -i -c exit  0.18s user 0.10s system 87% cpu 0.325 total
#$SHELL -i -c exit  0.18s user 0.10s system 87% cpu 0.325 total
#$SHELL -i -c exit  0.18s user 0.10s system 87% cpu 0.323 total
#$SHELL -i -c exit  0.18s user 0.10s system 86% cpu 0.330 total
```

The reason I could not go down below 300ms was because of `pyenv` and comfort
it provided for managing python versions and virtual environments for most of my
projects. Without `pyenv` initialization in my `~/.zshrc`, I was able to get 
startup time down to ~60s, which is what I wanted.

```sh
for i in $(seq 1 10); do time $SHELL -i -c exit; done
#$SHELL -i -c exit  0.02s user 0.03s system 52% cpu 0.067 total
#$SHELL -i -c exit  0.01s user 0.02s system 52% cpu 0.057 total
#$SHELL -i -c exit  0.01s user 0.02s system 52% cpu 0.057 total
#$SHELL -i -c exit  0.01s user 0.02s system 49% cpu 0.059 total
#$SHELL -i -c exit  0.01s user 0.02s system 53% cpu 0.057 total
#$SHELL -i -c exit  0.01s user 0.02s system 52% cpu 0.056 total
#$SHELL -i -c exit  0.01s user 0.02s system 53% cpu 0.055 total
#$SHELL -i -c exit  0.01s user 0.02s system 52% cpu 0.056 total
#$SHELL -i -c exit  0.01s user 0.02s system 51% cpu 0.058 total
#$SHELL -i -c exit  0.01s user 0.02s system 50% cpu 0.058 total
```

The cost to benefit ratio for pyenv was low for keeping `pyenv` because I used
it for all Python projects and the effort I would need to invest to finding
alternatives and making it work for same level of convinience had huge inertia.
In retrospect, I didn't spend too much time into optimizing `~/.zshrc` to get
`pyenv` to work while deferring this as part of the shell startup.

Here's how to defer instantializing `pyenv` while starting shell up. I learned
about `unfunction` while writing this post.
```sh
pyenv_init() {
  export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
  [[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
  eval "$(pyenv init -)"

  unfunction "$0"
}

python() {
  pyenv_init
  command python "$@"
}

pyenv() {
  pyenv_init
  command pyenv "$@"
}
```

Nevertheless, enter `uv`.

`uv` is Astral's project, which solves Python package and project management and
provides alternatives to a lot of tools - `pip`, `pipdeptree`, `pip-tools`,
`virtualenv`, standalone script dependencies, and python installations as well.
It checks more boxes than I need from my current ecosystem but there are some
pitfalls I get in return. So, instead of completely removing `pyenv` I'll run a
beta replacement for it for Jan 2025 and switch completely post that.

I have been using `uv` in personal projects since the 0.4.0 release hype, but
before I start to use it seriously I did an update to `uv` itself. There is a
convinient API available.

```sh
uv self update
#info: Checking for updates...
#success: Upgraded uv from v0.5.10 to v0.5.13! https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/tag/0.5.13
```

After that sorted, first step was to list all the Python versions and 
`pyenv-virtualenv` I use from `pyenv`.
```sh
pyenv versions
#* system (set by /Users/HSingh/.pyenv/version)
#  3.7.13
#  3.7.16
#  3.7.16/envs/[REDACTED]
#  3.9.16
#  3.10.6
#  3.11.6
#  3.11.6/envs/[REDACTED]
#  3.11.6/envs/[REDACTED]
#  3.11.7
#  3.11.7/envs/[REDACTED]
#  3.11.7/envs/[REDACTED]
#  3.11.8
#  3.11.8/envs/[REDACTED]
#  3.11.9
#  3.11.9/envs/[REDACTED]
#  3.11.9/envs/[REDACTED]
#  3.12.0
#  3.12.2
#  3.12.2/envs/[REDACTED]
#  3.12.2/envs/[REDACTED]
#  3.12.2/envs/[REDACTED]
#  3.12.2/envs/[REDACTED]
#  3.12.2/envs/[REDACTED]
```

In retrospect, I work on a lot of different python versions and have `venv` for
different projects for same Python version. In 2025, I'm going to move away from
Python 3.7 for most of my projects (I hope).

To do the same with uv, I did
```sh
uv python install 3.8 3.9 3.10 3.11 3.12 3.13
#Installed 6 versions in 3.22s
# + cpython-3.8.20-macos-aarch64-none
# + cpython-3.9.21-macos-aarch64-none
# + cpython-3.10.16-macos-aarch64-none
# + cpython-3.11.11-macos-aarch64-none
# + cpython-3.12.8-macos-aarch64-none
# + cpython-3.13.1-macos-aarch64-none
```

and then added aliases for Python version
```zshrc
alias python3.8='uv run --python=3.8 python3'
alias python3.9='uv run --python=3.9 python3'
alias python3.10='uv run --python=3.10 python3'
alias python3.11='uv run --python=3.11 python3'
alias python3.12='uv run --python=3.12 python3'
alias python3.13='uv run --python=3.13 python3'
alias python3=python3.12
```

With Python installation completed above, I have 6+3 Python installations. 6 of
them from the above step, 2 of them from Homebrew namely 3.12.8 and 3.13.1 and
1 (default) on MacOS installation i.e. 3.9.6.

```sh
uv python list --only-installed
#cpython-3.13.1-macos-aarch64-none     /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.13/bin/python3.13 -> ../Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/bin/python3.13
#cpython-3.13.1-macos-aarch64-none     /Users/HSingh/.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.13.1-macos-aarch64-none/bin/python3.13
#cpython-3.12.8-macos-aarch64-none     /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.12/bin/python3.12 -> ../Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/bin/python3.12
#cpython-3.12.8-macos-aarch64-none     /Users/HSingh/.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.12.8-macos-aarch64-none/bin/python3.12
#cpython-3.11.11-macos-aarch64-none    /Users/HSingh/.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.11.11-macos-aarch64-none/bin/python3.11
#cpython-3.10.16-macos-aarch64-none    /Users/HSingh/.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.10.16-macos-aarch64-none/bin/python3.10
#cpython-3.9.21-macos-aarch64-none     /Users/HSingh/.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.9.21-macos-aarch64-none/bin/python3.9
#cpython-3.9.6-macos-aarch64-none      /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/python3 -> ../../Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/3.9/bin/python3
#cpython-3.8.20-macos-aarch64-none     /Users/HSingh/.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.8.20-macos-aarch64-none/bin/python3.8
```

I like to keep the Python environment clean and install any tool for project in
a virtual environment, hence I didn't need to use the `uv tool install`. In
future I can do global package installation by doing `uv tool install 
pre-commit`. Skipping this for now, as we are in evaluation mode and I can live
with global `pre-commit` from Homebrew. Mentioned this point to make a note to
clean such tools later.

To check tools, I listed all packages I've installed with `pipx` as well and to
my surprise there was only 1 i.e. `harlequin`.

```sh
pipx list
#venvs are in /Users/[REDACTED]/.local/pipx/venvs
#apps are exposed on your $PATH at /Users/[REDACTED]/.local/bin
#manual pages are exposed at /Users/[REDACTED]/.local/share/man
#   package harlequin 1.20.0, installed using Python 3.12.3
#    - harlequin

pipx uninstall harlequin
#uninstalled harlequin! âœ¨ ðŸŒŸ âœ¨

pipx list
#nothing has been installed with pipx ðŸ˜´
```

Okay, now lets talk about project management and for this I chose a work project
where I created a new virtualenv and ran a build step

```sh
cd [PROJECT_NAME]

rm -rf .python-version

uv python install 3.12.6
#Installed Python 3.12.6 in 2.61s
# + cpython-3.12.6-macos-aarch64-none

uv venv --python 3.12.6
#Using CPython 3.12.6
#Creating virtual environment at: .venv
#Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

source .venv/bin/activate

python --version
#Python 3.12.6

uv pip install '.[dev]'
#Using Python 3.12.6 environment at: /Users/HSingh/code/github.com/majidalfuttaim/de-airflow/.venv
#Resolved 37 packages in 41.46s
#[REDACTED]
#Prepared 37 packages in 10.49s
#Installed 37 packages in 177ms

#Run a functionality to find it works as expected like
#pytest
#OR a custom script that I had
#python build.py
```

There might be better ways of doing above but, this works for me, so YMMV.

I'm going to delete `.python-version` files from projects (eventual consistency)
and when it is time to let go of `pyenv` completely, I can do below
- remove `pyenv init` from `~/.zshrc`
- remove custom function to recreate `pyenv-virtualenv` from `~/.zshrc`
- `rm -rf $(pyenv root)`
- `brew uninstall pyenv pyenv-virtualenv`

Ok, now talking about confusions.

First thing that I need to get out of my muscle memory is `pip install TOOL`. I
keep doing `pip list` and other `pip-tools` command often which is engrained to
my brain. I need to learn to unlearn and then get used to new way of usage.
Some temporary hacks is to create aliases but I can think many places this will
become an issue.

Secondly, when using `uv python` we are basically using the awesome
`python-build-standalone` project. Astral took stewardship of this project over
from Gregory Szorc and they are already contributing steadily to it. There are
some documented behavior quirks [^2] of PBS and none of them are affecting me
right now. We will need to keep watch for this though.

Thirdly, I'm not comfortable using unstable APIs at work. In this case, since
I'm changing only my development workflow, I'm less worried about it. At the
time of writing this article, latest `uv` version is 0.5.13 and I couldn't find 
a roadmap or a low-fidelity-bullet-point-path-to-1.0 in versioning policy [^3]
or otherwise. It is a thankless job to answer questions on an open-source
project but this is an important question for adoption of `uv`; hope Astral team
finds time to document a low fidelity roadmap for people like me to be
comfortable using and pitching `uv`.
