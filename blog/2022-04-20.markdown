# Day 1

## Meta

Its actually not day 1 but I'm calling it so for the lack of effort I want to 
put on the header, instead focus on content. I've been putting off from writing
content instead by starting on ideas and letting them die a slow death in
side-project-graveyard.

This time focus is to learn Golang and improve Python.

> I ask myself... Why?

I've not had a background in Computer Science but always have been tinkering
computers. On my first and second job as well, I've been surviving with partial
knowledge about languages, data structure and operating systems. I'm not trying
to get myself fired by saying I don't understand any of this; **I feel I can
understand programming and software engineering better**.

Hence, I'm focusing on two aspects here:
- Improve Python: I already know my way around Python. It is a language which
has let me experiment and create working solutions quickly. But I need to learn
fundamentals and get hold of whatever I know
- Learn Golang: So that I try out a modern, fast and memory safe language.
